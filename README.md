# bus

A tracker for the location of a bus. Inspired by Oslo's buses, [ruter#](https://ruter.no).

# Development

## prepare

First install the gems with: 

```sh
bundle install
```

For now this is simply done with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and deployed on [github pages](https://pages.github.com) at [haroen.me/bus](https://haroen.me/bus). 

## local

To preview locally (default at `localhost:4000`), use

```sh
jekyll serve
```

Or if you didn't have jekyll installed yet, do

```sh
gem install jekyll
```

In case you don't have Ruby/gem refer to [these](http://guides.rubygems.org/rubygems-basics/) instructions.

## deploying

Deploying is done to github pages with [travis](https://travis-ci.org).
